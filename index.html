            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Distance education is defi ned as a method of teaching where the student and teacher are physically separated. It can utilize a combination of technologies, including correspondence, audio, video, computer, and the Internet (Roffe, 2004).
                Todayâ€™s version of distance education is online education, which uses computers and the Internet as the delivery mechanism with at least 80% of the course content delivered online (Allen & Seaman, 2011; Shelton & Saltsman, 2005). Online
                education is no longer a trend, but mainstream. Of the 18.2 million students enrolled in higher education in the fall of 2007, 3.9 million (21.4%) were enrolled in at least one online course (Allen & Seaman, 2008; United States Department
                of Education, 2013). By fall 2010, the number of higher education students had risen to 21 million, and 6.1 million of those (29.0%) were enrolled in an online course (Allen & Seaman, 2011; United States Department of Education, 2013).
